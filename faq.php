                    <p>To plan a road trip using our app, simply navigate to the login section and create an account. From our home page, enter your desired starting point and destination. Select any waypoints or stops you'd like to include, and save the route once you're done. You can also look for things to do from our <a href="search.php">search</a> page. </p>

                    <p>Yes! Our map provides recommendations for attractions, restaurants, and other points of interest along your route, but we also encourage you to look for events a little further way and find noteworthy detours.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, our app does not currently support sharing trip plans with others. We plan to add collaborative trip planning as well as the ability for users to share their plans in the form of a generatable link, so please keep your eyes peeled!</p>
